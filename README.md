# Predicting User Retention â€“ Behavioral Analytics Case Study

This project simulates a realistic scenario where a product team seeks to identify what drives 14-day user retention in a mobile app.

## Project Objectives

- Simulate user behavior data: signup dates, session time, device type, onboarding status.
- Explore key drivers of retention.
- Build a predictive model to identify likely retained users.
- Extract insights to guide product and marketing strategies.

## Key Features

- Realistic behavioral data simulation
- Data preprocessing & EDA (session time, active days, churn pattern)
- Retention analysis by country, device, onboarding
- Predictive modeling using Logistic Regression
- Evaluation using classification metrics (precision, recall, f1, accuracy)

## Insights

- High engagement during first sessions is correlated with retention.
- Onboarding and profile completion significantly increase retention odds.
- Retention varies subtly across countries and platforms.
